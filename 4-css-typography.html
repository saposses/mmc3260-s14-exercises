        <h2>commas, coffee, cardigans</h2>
        <p>I chose my career for the commas and stayed for the stories, though I remain entirely too fixated on the minor apostrophe errors that pepper billboards. I’m a writer, an editor and a storyteller, and for some reason, the things that keep me going more often than not start with the letter “c”: coffee, cardigans, contemporary art and the thought of the cats I’ll adopt after graduation.</p>
